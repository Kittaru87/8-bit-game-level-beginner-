## Learning how to build a game ##

A small 23 Code Street project

The 1st level of a canvas sprite game

Just don't move him off the map because I haven't managed to implement collision detection yet. He will get lost.

### Future development ###
- Collision detection
- Randomised treasure and scoreboard for treasure pick-up
- Other levels - different backgrounds and barriers
- Enemies
- Music and sound effects for the various items
